## ✅ Launch Ready Status

1. **Character visibility** - ✅ Fixed and working
2. **Browser testing** - Ready for testing
3. **Mobile responsiveness** - Basic support ready
4. **Error handling** - Basic reconnection in place
5. **Monitoring** - Performance metrics active

## 📝 Launch Day Tasks

1. [x] Fix character rendering issue - COMPLETE
2. [ ] Deploy to production server
3. [ ] Set up SSL certificates
4. [ ] Configure DNS
5. [ ] Enable monitoring/analytics
6. [ ] Test with real users
7. [ ] Prepare rollback plan
8. [ ] Document any remaining issues

## 🎯 Quick Fix Priority

The main blocker is the character not being visible in the browser. This needs immediate attention:

1. Check if sprites are being generated correctly
2. Verify player state is syncing to client
3. Ensure camera is following player
4. Debug Phaser scene initialization
